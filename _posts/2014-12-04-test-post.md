This is my first post! A text post, not very exciting. :(

Let's look at some code: 

{% highlight swift %}
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
if location == nil || location!.horizontalAccuracy > newLocation.horizontalAccuracy {
            lastLocationError = nil
            location = newLocation
            updateLabels()
        }
        
if newLocation.horizontalAccuracy <= locationManager.desiredAccuracy {
            //println("We're done!!!!")
            stopLocationManager()
            configureGetButton()
            
	if distance > 0 {
	performingReverseGeocoding = false
            }
        }
{% endhighlight %}
